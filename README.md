# MSA Phase 1 2024 
This README file serves as my repository for any projects built under each modules in Phase 1 of the [Microsoft Student Accelerator (MSA) program](https://github.com/NZMSA/2024-Phase-1).

## Week 1
### Contosso Pizza
The Contoso Pizza project is a project done to understand how to build and navigate through a Web API. The main objectives include:

- Understanding the principles of RESTful API design.
- Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Exploring APIs with Command Line HTTP REPL.
- MVCS (Model View Controller Service) pattern.

## Week 2 
## Simple Website
Progressive enhancement - design strategy in web development that focuses on delivering a basic, functional experience to all users by putting an emphasis on web content first. This ensures that everyone can access the basic content and functionality of a web page while users with additional browser features receive the enhanced version. 

> **progressive** means creating a design that achieves a simpler but still-usable experience for those who have older browsers and devices with limited capabilities while at the same time, for those who have modern devices, it progresses the user experience to a more fully featured experience for users of newer browsers or devices

Separation of concerns- separating each layer of the web application to ensure it works independently
