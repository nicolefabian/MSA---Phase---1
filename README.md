# MSA Phase 1 2024 
This README file serves as my repository for any projects built under each modules in Phase 1 of the [Microsoft Student Accelerator (MSA) program](https://github.com/NZMSA/2024-Phase-1).

## Week 1

- Understanding the principles of RESTful API design.
- Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Exploring APIs with Command Line HTTP REPL.
- MVCS (Model View Controller Service) pattern.
